This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles:  failure to correctly specify the requirements.txt file location or missing file entirely.  The initial Dockerfile (Dockerfile) contains the error. The corrected Dockerfile (Dockerfile_fixed) provides the solution.  This often happens due to typos or incorrect assumptions about the working directory within the Docker image.
